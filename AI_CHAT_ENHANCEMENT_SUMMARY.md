## ðŸŽ¨ **User Experience Improvements**

### **Before (Weak AI Chat):**
```
User: "I need to finish the project report"
AI: "Great! I've created a task: 'finish the project report'. 
     I've estimated it will take 30 minutes and set the priority to 50/100."
```

### **After (Smart AI Chat):**
```
User: "I need to finish the project report by Friday"
AI: "Great! I've created a task: 'Finish project report'. 
     I've estimated it will take 120 minutes and marked it as high priority (85/100). 
     This seems urgent! I've tagged it with: work, urgent.

Questions to consider:
â€¢ What specific sections need to be completed?
â€¢ Do you need to gather any additional information?
â€¢ Who needs to review the report?

Quick actions:
â€¢ Start a focus session now
â€¢ Add more details to the task
â€¢ Create another related task
â€¢ View all your tasks"
```
